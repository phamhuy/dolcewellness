Please remember that your session time includes undressing and redressing as well as professional consultation and recommendation from your therapist.

We will do our best to accommodate your needs; However, the full amount will be charged, and the full session time is not guaranteed.<\/p>\n<h2>Spa Environment<\/h2>\n<p>For the considerations of you and other guests, we ask that you turn off your cellphones and speak softly within the spa.<\/p>\n<h2>During The Service<\/h2>\n<p>Please let us know about the room temperature, the music volume, the massage pressure, etc. We can adjust to make sure you have a most relaxing experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Get Comfortable<\/h2>\n<p>Your therapist will step out for a moment, allowing you to disrobe (to your comfort level) and lay onto a table underneath the top sheet and blanket. During your massage, your therapist will only uncover the areas of your body they\u2019re working on.<\/p>\n<h2>During your massage<\/h2>\n<p>You can ask for either a full-body massage (for general relaxation) or a customized session focusing on specific parts of your body. And remember, your comfort matters. Feel free to talk with your therapist as much, or as little, as you wish.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay relaxed<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to relax your mind and muscles during your massage. Breathe normally and try not to tighten or contract your muscles. Maintain open lines of communication with your therapist if you\u2019d like to provide feedback on their pressure or techniques.<\/p>\n<h2>Jewelries\/Valuables<\/h2>\n<p>Please remove your jewelries and leave your valuables at home. We are not responsible for lost or stolen items. Undress to your comfort level:<\/p>\n<p>Some prefer to keep their undergarments on during a massage, while others prefer to remove them. Either way, you will always be professional draped.<\/p>\n<h2>Cancellations<\/h2>\n<p>To cancel or reschedule your appointment, we require 24- hour notice to avoid being charged a cancellation fee of $50 flat fee.<\/p>\n<h2>Deposit and pre-authorization<\/h2>\n<p>We hold the amount to verify a customer&#8217;s card, with the plan to charge it fully at a later date as a guarantee in case the customer no-shows.<\/p>\n<h2>No-shows<\/h2>\n<p>will be charged 100% of services.<\/p>\n<h2>Gratuities<\/h2>\n<p>Customary gratuities are typically 15-25% of the non &#8211; member rates, based on satisfaction of your experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Gift Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Gift cards can only be used at the studio where they were purchased. Gift cards are non-refundable, have no cash value and unless stated do not include gratuity.
